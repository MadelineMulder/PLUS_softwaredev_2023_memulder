For our final project my group is looking to develop a web map to provide emergency responders with updated routing options during flood events in the Bahamas. As such, I thought it would be a good idea to work with the folium library for this assignment with a focus on our study area in order to explore visualization options for our project. I created some fake hurricane data using pandas and used the foilum library to create a bubble map of hurricane severity on the Grand Bahama Island that also includes the country boundary and a flood hazard marker. Below you can see a screenshot of the final web map of the bahamas that was created with the script included in this assignment folder. There is also an environment file included in this folder which, if used, ensures that jupyter notebook, pandas, and folium are all installed as they are required in order for the script to run correctly.
