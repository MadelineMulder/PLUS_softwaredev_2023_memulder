To complete Assignment 2 I only used git bash and the anaconda prompt. My first step was to clone the software development repository to get access to the environment files to reproduce. 

	Steps and commands in git bash: 

	1. Cloned repository: git clone https://github.com/augustinh22/geo-software-dev.git  
	
	Steps and commands in Anaconda prompt:

	2. Navigated to correct folder in the repo: cd desktop, cd geo-software-dev, cd A2

	3. Created environment: conda env create -f software_dev_v1.yml

	4. Activated environment: conda activate software_dev_v1.yml

	5. Installed colored package: conda install -c conda-forge colored

	6. Checked that colored package was successfully added: conda list

	7. Exported modified environment file: conda env export > software_dev_v1_memulder.yml

	8. Deactivate environment: conda deactivate

I then pushed the modified environment file to my personal repo on github. 

	Steps and commands in git bash:

	1. Cloned personal repo: git clone https://github.com/MadelineMulder/PLUS_softwaredev_2023_memulder.git

	2. Navigated to my personal repo: cd desktop, cd PLUS_softwaredev_2023_memulder

	2. Manually copied file from software development repo to personal repo 

	3. Added file to staging area of personal repo: git add software_dev_v1_memulder.yml

	4. Commited file with description: git commit -m "my description"

	5. pushed file to repo: git push origin main

I was not able to reproduct the second environment as each time I tried to create the environment it got stuck spinning on the "solving environment" step.
